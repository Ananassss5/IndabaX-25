This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook (indabax-25-c1-datamastodons.ipynb) by the DataMastodons team for the IndabaX 2025 Challenge 1, tackling a multi-label classification task to predict 4G/LTE network performance metrics like e-RAB setup and handover failures using features such as downlink bandwidth and PRB load. 

Our approach leverages a MultiOutputClassifier with XGBClassifier and LightGBM, achieving a validation Hamming Loss of 0.0020.
